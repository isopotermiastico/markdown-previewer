# Markdown Previewer

A simple Markdown Previewer built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project lets you write Markdown text in a textarea and see a live preview of the formatted HTML instantly.

## Features

- **Real-time preview:** Updates as you type in the editor.  
- **Markdown parsing:** Uses [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) to convert Markdown to HTML.  
- **Safe HTML rendering:** Uses [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to sanitize the output and prevent XSS attacks.    


## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Type Markdown in the left-hand editor.  
3. See the live preview on the right-hand side.

## Notes

This project helped practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with third-party libraries via CDN.

Focus was on functionality and learning, not design aesthetics.
